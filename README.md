# Machine Learning (EE5184) 2024 Fall 
This repo contains both math and programming homework of the Machine Learning course (course ID: EE5184) in 2024 Fall semester. 

There are total 5 HWs, the topics are:

1. [Linear Regresstion](/HW1_due0927)
    -  Train linear regression model to predict PM2.5 levels
    -  Experiment with diffrerent variable combinatins (or via feature selection) to select the model with the best prediction perfromance
2. [CNN for picture classification](/HW2_due_1028)
    - Train a CNN network to classify the emotion shown in an image
    - Apply data augmentation techniques to reduce overfitting
3. [Autoencoder for semi-supervised learning](/HW3_due_1108)
    - Use an autoencoder arcitechure to handle scenarios wiht limited labeled training data
    - Use the learned embeddings from the autoencoder to generate label predictions
4.  [Classification via optimizing AUC & Clustering](/HW4_due_1108)
     - Train a classification model for a diasease by optimizing the AUC of the ROC curve
     - Apply various techniques to deal with imbalance data
     - Perform an ablation study to identify critical/important features
     - Implement a modified KNN clustering algorithm
5.  [Tabular Reinforcement Learning](/HW5_due1220)
     - Design and implement reward schedules during the learning process
     - Experiment with different action-selection strategies
