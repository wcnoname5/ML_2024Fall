# Machine Learning (EE5184) 2024 Fall 
This repo contains both math and programming homework of the Machine Learning course (course ID: EE5184) in 2024 Fall semester. 

There are total 5 HWs, the topics are:

1. [Linear Regresstion](/HW1_due0927)
    -  Training linear regression to predict PM2.5 data
    -  Using variable selection to select the model with best prediction  
2. [CNN for picture classification](/HW2_due_1028)
    - Train a CNN network to classify the emotion of a given picture
    - Apply data augmentation on training data to avoid overfitting
3. [Autoencoder for semi-supervised learning](/HW3_due_1108)
    - Use autoencoder arcitechure to deal with cases where only a small amount of labeled training data
    - Use the embeddings of in autoencoder to generate a prediction 'label'
4.  [Classification via optimizing AUC & Clustering](/HW4_due_1108)
     - Training a classification model for a diasease via optimizing AUC of ROC curve
     - Can try various techniques to deal with imbalance data.
     - Perform ablation studies to find out critical/important varibales.
     - Implement a modified KNN clustering algorithm.
5.  [Tabular Reinforcement Learning](/HW5_due1220)
     - Implement rewarding schedule on learning process
     - Try on different action-selection strategies
